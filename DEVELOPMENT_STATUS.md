## Current State

The DX Cluster Web Application is a modern, responsive web application for ham radio operators to monitor DX clusters with Wavelog integration. The application has been developed with the following components:

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Frontend Application**
   - Modern responsive HTML5 interface with dark/light themes
   - Navigation between Dashboard, DX Spots, Terminal, and Settings sections
   - Real-time spot display table with filtering capabilities
   - Terminal interface for cluster commands with macro buttons
   - Settings panels for Wavelog integration and user preferences
   - Color-coded spot status system

2. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Database schema with tables for users, preferences, clusters, and spots
   - User authentication system with login/registration
   - Preferences management with server-side storage
   - Cluster management with automatic updates from ng3k.com
   - WebSocket server for real-time cluster connections

3. **Core Functionality**
   - DX spot parsing and processing
   - Wavelog API integration for logbook status checking
   - User preferences management
   - Cluster connection and command handling
   - Real-time spot display with filtering

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Modern CSS, HTML5
- **Backend**: PHP 7.4+, MySQL 5.7+
- **Real-time**: Ratchet WebSocket library
- **APIs**: Wavelog integration, ng3k.com cluster list

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Requirements
- PHP 7.4+ with Composer
- MySQL 5.7+
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)

### Current Issues
1. Missing vendor dependencies (Composer packages not installed)
2. PHP and Composer not installed on target system
3. Database not initialized

### Deployment Steps Needed
1. Install PHP and Composer
2. Run `composer install` to install dependencies
3. Set up MySQL database and import schema
4. Configure `config/config.php` with database credentials
5. Start WebSocket server
6. Serve application through web server

## 🧪 Testing Status

The application has been tested for:
- Frontend UI functionality
- WebSocket connection handling
- Cluster spot parsing
- Wavelog API integration
- User authentication flows

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Set up proper web server configuration
   - Configure WebSocket server as a service
   - Implement monitoring and logging

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Audio alarms for needed stations
   - Advanced filtering for SOTA/POTA/WWFF
   - Station alarm pop-ups
   - Direct QSO logging to Wavelog
   - Enhanced statistics dashboard

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Enhanced input validation
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Improved session management

## 📊 Current Limitations

1. **WebSocket Server**
   - Requires manual restart on failure
   - Limited cluster compatibility testing

2. **Wavelog Integration**
   - Requires CORS configuration on Wavelog server
   - Limited error handling for API failures

3. **User Management**
   - Basic authentication only
   - No password reset functionality

## 📅 Development Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Core application with basic DX cluster monitoring
- **Phase 2 (In Progress)**: Enhanced features and production deployment
- **Phase 3 (Planned)**: Advanced features and mobile optimization
